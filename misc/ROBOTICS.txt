ROBOTICS
- Using the robot
	- Take out the controller
	- Verify the emergency stop button is not engaged
	- Place the controller back and push the green button.
	- That should engage the robot.
- The first yellow button
	- To switch between modes.
	- Make sure it's set to manual/program (hand sign)
	- to the left of the hand sign is the automatic mode

- Speed selection
	- Use low speeds 20-50%

- Main Menu
	- Application manager
		- Here, the transferred files can be found under disk or USB drive if connected
	- Task manager

	- Control panel

	- Calibration
- Joint button (mode)
	- movement is based on individual joints as in the numbers 1- 6
	- Joint 1 is base or world frame and 6 is the tcp
- Frame button (mode)
	- movement is based on frames X Y Z, rx ry rz
	- X = back and front
	- Y = left and right
	- Z = up and down
	- rx = rotation around x etc.
- Tool button (mode)
	- controls the tool
- Point button (mode)
	- 

- To load application
	> Application Manager > val3 applications > disk > *program name* > F8 (ok) >
	> Then we can set points by clicking point mode > relative to flange or tool if you have any > F8
	> If you already have points in your application, you can select any of those points and move there
	> by pressing and hold MOVE.
- In the loaded application, the Mode is set to LINE but can be changed using F7 to something like ALIGN.
	to maybe align your tool with the table.
- If you switch to ALIGN mode and click MOVE, the tool or flange aligns with the table and this position can 	
	be saved by changing to JOINT mode (F7) and selecting which point (P1 or ..) to be replaced and 
	clicking here (F1). Then F4 to save all changes.
- To run a program
	> Application Manager > val3 applications > disk > *program name* > F8 (ok) >
	> Switch to AUTOMATIC mode (left of hand sign) > press power (green button) >
	> Hit RUN (left of frame button) > F8 (okay) > MOVE button.
- To pause a program
	> Hit Move button.
- To stop a program
	> Hit Stop button (above speed).

- Home and Work are joints.
- A and B are points.
Approximate mouth is a point with rpt to the patient (frame_)
