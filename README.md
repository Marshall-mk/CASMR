# Dental Assistant Project

This project is part of the Computer Aided Surgery and Medical Robotics (CASMR) course. It involves programming a robot to perform dental operations.


## Description

The project consists of several components:

- **CAD**: Contains the kinematic and simulation files for the robot.
- **Controller1**: Contains the controller configuration, logs, system configurations, and user applications.
- **Layouts**: Contains layout configurations.
- **misc**: Contains miscellaneous files related to robotics.

## Key Files

- `Dental Assistant.kxml`: Main kinematic configuration file.
- `Controller1.controller`: Controller configuration file.
- `errors.log`: Log file for errors.
- `Anesthesia.pjx`: Project file for the Anesthesia application.
- `simulation.xml`: Simulation configuration file.

## How to Run

1. Ensure the robot controller is properly connected and configured.
2. Load the application using the Application Manager on the robot controller.
3. Switch to AUTOMATIC mode and press the power button.
4. Hit RUN to start the dental operation program.
